# Noise of electronics

## ADC calibration

 - 5,5 MeV alpha-particle create a signal with integral of 200000 ADC channels (private communication with Alexander Inglessi) 
 - A fake 1 mm track with 5,5 MeV energy deposit is created 
 - It produces  150684 ionization electrons 
 - Integral for the Flash ADC spectrum is 152022
 - 1 electron has “weight” =  (200000 / 152022)
